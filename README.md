# Thanatos Color Theme

## A dark theme that's easy to read, good for long sessions.

Based and inspired on other color schemes and things I liked here and there, some care was given to readability of selected text.

If you want to have Bracket Pair Colorizer match the theme, here's some code to get you started
```
"bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": [
    "#0099ad",
    "#928ba6",
    "#d8cb32",
    "#008486"
  ],
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.unmatchedScopeColor": "#fef8ec"
```

Please enjoy it, modify it, critique it and share it.
